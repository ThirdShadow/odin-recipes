Before working on the project: 

This project is supposed to put the basic HTML knowledge which I have accumulated to use, by creating a website with multiple recipes. It will probably require text, lists, links, images and all of the other basics. I expect to consolidate my knowledge by completing it.

After working on the project:

A few notes come to mind. Firstly, sometimes it is necessary to use characters that aren't common in English. For these, it is probably best to use the HTML symbols rather than typing them directly. Also, images found on the internet can be slightly awkward. They can be in not only JPG format, but saved as WebP files. These can be converted to JPGs using online web converters or software. Remembering WebP as a format is still probably worthwhile. Images downloaded off the internet should usually be resized when included in a website.
