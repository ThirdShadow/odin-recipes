# odin-recipes
Before working on the project: 

This project is supposed to put the basic HTML knowledge which I have accumulated to use, by creating a website with multiple recipes. It will probably require text, lists, links, images and all of the other basics. I expect to consolidate my knowledge by completing it.

After working on the project:

A few notes come to mind. Firstly, sometimes it is necessary to use characters that aren't common in English. For these, it is probably best to use the HTML symbols rather than typing them directly. Also, images found on the internet can be slightly awkward. They can be in not only JPG format, but saved as WebP files. These can be converted to JPGs using online web converters or software. Remembering WebP as a format is still probably worthwhile. Images downloaded off the internet should usually be resized when included in a website.

On returning to the Odin Project in 2024 I simply wanted to finish this project quickly and move on, only doing so because I knew that it would be needed for the CSS work later on. In the process, I refreshed my memory on HTML links, the structure of project directories, how to download a repository on Github to your local machine, how to update these files on Github after making local changes and on commit messages, though some revision about that would likely still be useful. The website is simple and regardless of the actual content, fully functional.
