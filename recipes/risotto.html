        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Italian recipe with multiple variations. This one contains chicken, others may include mushrooms or different ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Risotto rice (0.6 kg)</li>
                <li>Chicken (1 kg)</li>
                <li>Red pepper (2)</li>
                <li>Garlic (2 cloves)</li>
                <li>Pesto (1 jar)</li>
                <li>Bacon (300 kg, sliced into cubes)</li>
                <li>Chicken stock (1 teaspoon)</li>
                <li>White whine (1 tablespoon)</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large frying pan at a medium heat with oil. Slice the pepper and cut the chicken into pieces while it heats up.</li>
                <li>Cook the bacon for about 2 minutes, and remove it from the pan. At the same time, start heating a saucer to cook the rice, following whatever instructions are on the packet.</li>
                <li>Raise the heat slightly and put the chicken into the pan. Remove it when cooked slightly (it should look white but not yellow).</li>
                <li>Cook the pepper and garlic together in the pan. Boil some water in the kettle or in a saucer at the same time (about 1 litre).</li>
                <li>Add the chicken back into the pan along with the rice, and pour the jar of pesto in to the mixture, and stir.</li>
                <li>Fill the pan with the water, add the stockl, and stir.</li>
                <li>Keep refilling the pan with water when it evaporates, and on one instance, the white wine. Wait for the risotto to finish cooking. The rice should be soft.</li>
            </ol>
